AuthlogicCas
============

AuthlogicCas is a CAS (a cross-site authentication system designed at Yale for single sign-on authentication) add-on for the Authlogic authentication system.

This extension requires the Rubycas-client plugin and a working CAS server with which it will communicate for CAS authentication.  You can get this plugin at http://code.google.com/p/rubycas-client/  By installing and configuring your CAS client as outlined in the Rubycas-client documentation, the session variable, session[:cas_user], containing the login credentials of a CAS-authenticated user, will be presented to this adapter.

When using this extension, calls to persist your Authlogic session should work seamlessly, such as:

UserSession.find

You will need to add a session persistence before_filter in your controller like

before_filter CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter

 or

before_filter CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::GatewayFilter

to set session[:cas_user] for use with this add-on.
