Howto do test searches against ldap.kth.se

ssh -L 9999:ldap.kth.se:389 blame@my.nada.kth.se
ldapsearch -x -h localhost -p 9999 -b ou=Addressbook,dc=kth,dc=se ugUsername=blame


Insert your ugid into config/local.yml in order to get the controller specs to work properly (otherwise the test code can't log in)
